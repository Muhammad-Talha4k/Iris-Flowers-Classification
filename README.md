# Iris Flowers Classification using Logistic Regression Classifier

This project aims to classify iris flowers into three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width using Logistic Regression classifier. The dataset used for this project is the [Iris dataset], which contains 150 records of iris flowers, with 50 records for each species.

## Installation and Usage

To run this project, you will need the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy sklearn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Result

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 97.77%

The model was able to classify most of the flowers correctly, but it also had one false positive and one false negative. The count plot shows the distribution and the relationship of the features for each species.
